### Project Brainstorm

## Idea 1:

Concept: One of the struggles in life is when it's raining and my car's wiper is leaving streaks on the window because of trapped debris/dead plants. As someone who park his car outdoors, I often find myself in the situation where there's a constant streak left on the windshield when the car's already on the highway.

<br>
How: Using a small wheel-based machine to run along the blade of the wiper to manually clean it while the car is still in motion.
<br>
Power: using a small battery pack that could be recharged with a solar panel.

## Idea 2:

Concept: Creating a small buggy that can measure out certain lengths and mark it using tape. This is useful for jumping events in Track and Field such as the Long Jump, Triple Jump, ETC. because oftentimes when athletes are training alone its difficult to accurately measure out run-up distances with a tape measure by themselves.

How: Create a resonably sized motorized buggy to move certain distances based on the distance entered. Inputs can be registered through buttons or through a capacitive numpad. Motors will drive the vehicle and the distance can be converted from the motors' revolutions. Another motor will spin the roll of tape which would then be cut and stuck to the ground using servos or motors. Using a light sensor, the buggy could then track the difference in value from the white lines to keep it moving in a straight line.
